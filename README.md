### The Main Grid
Click the boxes in the grid to be given a selection of everything that meets the criteria and pick your favorites. You can also remove a pick from your box by clicking again and selecting the X sprite.

### The Final Favorites
The last square in each row and column will give you all the Skylanders you picked before it, for the ultimate showdown of who your favorite Skylander is.

## Write, Import, Download
At the very bottom of the page there are three buttons and a textbox.

**Download Image** is easy, it downloads your result as a single .png file. This should work for mobile users now as well.

**Write Code** will convert the grid into a text form. You can save this as a backup, or manually edit it, see Overwriting.

**Import Code** then takes that code written in the textbox and puts it back into the grid.

#### Overwriting
If you want to do something like put Crash Bandicoot as your favorite Spyros Adventure Fire or Kaos as your favorite land vehicle, put a filler Skylander in that position, then click Write Code, replace that Skylanders's name with the one you want, then click Import Code. Most Skylanders will just be their names with camel case capitalization (TriggerHappy), but alternate forms will have a preface (LightCoreEruptor). You can verify a name by putting it in the grid by itself and writing the code.
